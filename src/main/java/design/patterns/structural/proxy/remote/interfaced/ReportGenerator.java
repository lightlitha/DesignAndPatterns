/**
 * We have an interface ReportGenerator and its concrete implementation
 * ReportGeneratorImpl already running at JVMs of different locations. First to
 * create a remote service we need to change the codes
 * This is a remote interface which defines the methods that a client can call remotely. 
 * Itâ€™s what the client will use as the class type for your service.
 * Both the Stub and actual service will implement this.
 * The method in the interface returns a String object. You can return any object from the method;
 * this object is going to be shipped over the wire from the server back to the client,
 * so it must be Serializable.
 * Please note that all the methods in this interface should throw RemoteException
